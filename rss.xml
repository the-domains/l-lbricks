            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It Took 20 Pounds Of LEGO To Make Doom's BFG 9000</h1><p>The gloriously-named ZaziNombies YouTube channel creates LEGO versions of video game weapons, among other things. Somehow they've gone five years without building Doom's famous BFG 9000. Maybe it just took them a while to gather the 5,000+ bricks.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5834f61f2a0d6351c63217dec3bd33a8504a3228.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Have LEGO dropped the ball on this years D2C sets?</h1><p>I refrained from adding my view on the latest LEGO exclusive in yesterdays press release but personally I think this year the exclusive D2C sets have been found lacking and very over priced. The Ghostbusters HQ was really good and probably we are holding it in higher regard due to everything else released.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/56f48ada93c957fbfbe8ca29357e46c1e3993944.jpg"></article>]]></description>
